    "content": "If you\u2019re interested in trying AI chatbots, you're probably considering ChatGPT or Gemini, two of the biggest names in the space. Both are impressive, but there are some distinct differences you should know about. Whereas ChatGPT focuses on the accuracy and detail of its responses, Gemini prioritizes deep integrations across Google apps. And that's just one important difference between them. I've tested and reviewed both chatbots and am here to compare them across a number of key categories to help you determine which is best for your AI needs.\r\n\r\nDisclosure: Ziff Davis, PCMag's parent company, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April 2025, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.",
